\sec {Task description}

\textit {
    In collaboration with SafeLog, the laboratory demonstrator TurtleBot was created
    for robot fleet trajectory planning in automated warehouses. The goal of this semestral
    project is to analyze this framework and improve upon its codebase.
}
\begitems
* Get acquainted with the current state of development of the demonstrator and the simulator for multi-agent planning (https://github.com/Kei18/mapf-IR).
* Modify the simulator to serve as the basic user interface (GUI) of the demonstrator.
* Display robot positions obtained from the Vicon system in the GUI
* Integrate the supplied components for planning and generating plans into the system.

Initial stage
\typosize[14/14]
\begitems
* inspected current state
* inspected mapfIR
* proposed plan to continue
\enditems

\sec {Work plan}

* Original plan
\typosize[14/14]
\begitems
* enable purely virtual run
* create GUI (as one app)
* edit input format
* edit output format
* enable output generation in application
\enditems

* Changed mainly due to incompatibility of openFrameworks

\sec {Work plan}

* Changed plan
\typosize[14/14]
\begitems
* improved original app code separation and tooling (1w)
* enabled purely virtual run (1w)
* proposed plan to create GUI (1w)
* tried to merge projects with different build systems (3w)
* decided to split into multiple applications (1w)
* prepared tooling and distributed datastructures (1w)
* implemented GUI (1w)

\sec {Retrospective}

* Went well
\typosize[14/14]
\begitems
* communication
* task visibility
* general application state
\enditems

* Could have been better
\typosize[14/14]
\begitems
* effort evaluation
* cleaning original repository and establishing new
* committing on time basis rather than feature basis
\enditems

\sec {Future}

* Tasks planned
\typosize[14/14]
\begitems
* standardize IO formats with mapfIR
* move to discrete time steps
* enable generation of plans in application
* connect Vicon ?
* enable multiple view terminals connected at once
