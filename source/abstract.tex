\abstractEN {
    This work is analyzing and improving upon the multiagent planning system demonstrator currently used at the Department of Cybernetics.
    The main objective is to improve existing functionality, add new features and enable the usage of {\mapfIR} format. 
    It will greatly improve developer experience for other students working and running simulations developing algorithms for the {\mapfIR} solver.

\thanks {
    I would really like to thank my supervisor
    {\kulich} for great mentoring and guidance and providing great advice when it was needed. I would also like to thank to {\rybecky} for providing the base software solution and for introducing me to the problem domain. Finally, I
    would like to acknowledge the co-authors of the original Fleet Management System and its components, mainly Ing. Lukáš Bertl and Ing. Jakub Hvězda Ph.D..

\specification {
    In collaboration with SafeLog, the laboratory demonstrator TurtleBot was created for robot fleet trajectory planning in automated warehouses. The goal of this semestral project is to analyze this framework and improve upon its codebase.
