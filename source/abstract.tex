    This work is analyzing and improving upon the multiagent planning system demonstrator currently used at the Department of Cybernetics.
    The main objective is to improve existing functionality, add new features and enable the usage of {\mapfIR} format. 
    The final software should greatly improve the developer experience for future students developing algorithms for the {\mapfIR} solver, enhance the impression when presenting to $3^{rd}$ parties, and

\thanks {
    I would like to thank my supervisor
    {\kulich}, for excellent mentoring and guidance and providing great advice when it was needed. I would also like to thank {\rybecky} for providing the base software solution and for introducing me to the problem domain. Finally, I
    would like to acknowledge the co-authors of the original Fleet Management System and its components, mainly Ing. Lukáš Bertl and Ing. Jakub Hvězda Ph.D. The original mapfIR project also rightfully deserves appreciation.

\specification {
    As part of the EU solution of the {\safeLog} project, a laboratory demonstrator with TurtleBot robots was created for trajectory planning for a group of robots in an automated warehouse. The aim of the thesis is to get acquainted with this environment and develop it further. The final software should enhance the user experience of the previous demonstrator version.
