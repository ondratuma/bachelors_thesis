\chap Implementation
In this chapter I will describe my implementation and the particular solutions used to comply with decisions made in chapter ~\ref[chapter_implementation_decisions].

\sec Application architecture
The application is split between server part and frontend part.
Communicating through abstract interface built upon \nanomsg.

Both parts of application have shared utils classes. The main classes used for communication are Messenger and Message, providing easy-to-use interface and abstracting the network layer away from the programmer. The basic hierarchy of used communication classes is below.
\communication_uml

Server and Frontend each have its own instance of messenger asociated with given message type, communicating through api defined by given messenger.

\sec GUI application
The GUI is implemented using {\of}.
