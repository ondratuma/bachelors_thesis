\mapfIR is 
\uv{
    A simulator and visualizer of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), used in a paper "Iterative Refinement for Real-Time Multi-Robot Path Planning" (to appear at IROS-21). It is written in C++(17) with CMake (â‰¥v3.16) build. The repository uses Google Test and the original library for 2D pathfinding as git submodules. The visualizer uses openFrameworks and works only on macOS.
