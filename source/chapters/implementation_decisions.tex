\chap Implementation decisions
In this chapter, I will briefly describe the implementation requirements provided and decisions that were necessary before the actual implementation

\sec Current implementation
The {\oldRepo} is using {\cmake} build system. It provides great benefits compared to {\makefile}. Mainly portability across multiple build systems.
The primary decision was that we were to keep this build system for the server part of the application. This will be important later when choosing gui in the section ~\ref[choosing_gui]


\label[choosing_gui]
\sec GUI library considerations 
The primary candidate for GUI library was {\of}. It provides extensive amount of addons ranging greatly in functionality, with the pros being mainly:
\begitems \style n
    * Event loop synchronized with framerate
    * Interacting with the canvas using framework apis
    * Rich set of GUI widgets (buttons, text fields, etc.)
\enditems
with the only downside being it's dependence on \makefile. Therefore we are not able to use the official version with our build system.
