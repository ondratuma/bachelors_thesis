\chap Summary
The aim of this thesis was to improve upon the previous version of the FleetControl demonstrator and achieve compatibility with the {\mapfIR} project. 
At first, the {\mapfIR} project was analysed in order to identify key features, and decide which ones are desirable in the final software. Later, the {\oldRepo} was reviewed to determine the current state of development and provide us with the ability to determine the path to the final goal. Then, the software design was discussed based on the outcome of previous analysis, and implemented in later stage.
