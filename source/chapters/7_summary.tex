\chap Summary
The aim of this thesis was to improve upon the previous version of the FleetControl demonstrator and achieve compatibility with the format used by the {\mapfIR} project.The work was structured as follows.\br
At first, the {\mapfIR} project was analysed in order to identify key features, and decide which ones are desirable in the final software. Afterwards, the {\oldRepo} was reviewed to determine the current state of development and provide us with the ability to determine the path to the final goal. Then, the  software design and decisions for implementation was discussed. The final stage of the project was the implementation itself, where the core features were implemented first, followed by the non crucial ones.\br
The evaluation metrics for the project are the factual criteria given in the assignment. Particularly 
\begitems \style n
    * Get acquainted with the current state of development of the demonstrator and the simulator for multi-agent planning (https://github.com/Kei18/mapf-IR).
    * Modify the simulator to serve as the basic user interface (GUI) of the demonstrator.
    * Display robot positions obtained from the {\vicon} system in the GUI.
    * Integrate the supplied components for planning and plan execution into the demonstrator.
    * Evaluate experimentally properties of the implemented system. Describe and discuss obtained results.
\enditems
The criteria mentioned in the assignment were successfully fulfilled.
Another important criteria that I'd like to evaluate, is one that arose from actual usage of the original software. It is the user experience when working with the demonstrator and the actual ability to use the demonstrator.
The evaluation of this criteria has have been discussed in the chapter {\ref[system_properties]}, and concluded to be more than satisfactory, enhancing user experience greatly when compared to the original project.\br
The future steps will probably include addition of new synchronization algorithms(\ref[synchronization_strategy]) and introduction of support for in-app rerouting, incorporating selected algorithms supported by {\mapfIR} and enabling easy addition and development of custom algorithms.
