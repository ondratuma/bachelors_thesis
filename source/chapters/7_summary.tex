\chap Summary
The aim of this thesis was to improve upon the previous version of the FleetControl demonstrator and achieve compatibility with the format used by the {\mapfIR} project.The work was structured as follows.\br
At first, the {\mapfIR} project was analysed in order to identify key features, and decide which ones are desirable in the final software. Afterwards, the {\oldRepo} was reviewed to determine the current state of development and provide us with the ability to determine the path to the final goal. Then, the  software design and decisions for implementation was discussed. The final stage of the project was the implementation itself, where the core features were implemented at first, followed bz the non crucial ones.\br
The evaluation metrics for the project are mainly the usability and user experience, that have been discussed in the chapter {\ref[system_properties]}, and concluded to be more than satisfactory, enhancing user experience greatly.\br
The future steps will probably include addition of new synchronization algorithms(\ref[synchronization_strategy]) and introduction of support for in-app rerouting, incorporating selected algorithms supported by {\mapfIR} and enabling easy addition and development of custom algorithms.
