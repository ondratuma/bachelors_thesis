\chap Summary
The main goal of this thesis was to improve upon the previous version of the FleetControl demonstrator and achieve compatibility with the {\mapfIR} project. 
The work on this thesis may be described in 4 distinct steps.\br
The first step consisted of analyzing the {\mapfIR} project, in order to identify key features, and decide which ones are desirable in the final software. 
\br
Second task was to analyze the original FleetControl codebase, and the general idea behind the demonstrator. It was crucial to identify what parts can be kept, and what needs to be modified.
\br
After completing the required analysis, it was necessary to decide how to approach the final solution and prepare the implementation plan.
